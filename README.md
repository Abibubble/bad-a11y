## Anyone not in Technology

The aim of this page is to practice your accessibility issue finding skills and your designing accessibly. Take a look though and write down any issues that you can find.

Finally, create a re-design for the page that's fully accessible (including states). Don't worry about the re-design being fully fleshed out, but feel free to change anything.
